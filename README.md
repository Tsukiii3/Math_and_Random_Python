#  Math_and_Random_Python

This repository contains small Python scripts focused on practicing **fundamental Python concepts**, especially using the built-in **math** and **random** modules.

The goal of this project is to help beginners understand basic operations, calculations, and simple logic through practical examples.

---

##  Contents

The scripts in this repository cover fundamental Python concepts, such as:

* Basic mathematical operations
* Random number generation
* Trigonometric calculations
* Number manipulation (integer part, hypotenuse, angles)
* Basic programming logic and input/output handling

---

##  Available Files

* **random_number.py** → Generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1
* **integer_part.py** → Displays only the integer part of a real number
* **hypotenuse.py** → Calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle
* **trigonometry.py** → Calculates sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle
* **random_student.py** → Randomly selects one student from a list
* **shuffle_students.py** → Randomly shuffles the order of students

---

##  Technologies Used
